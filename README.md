# RSV_ABM-Lab

To evaluate immunization programs with the next generation of RSV prophylactics, I developed an agent-based transmission model, 
parameterized with the estimated RSV disease burden in Nunavik. We evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various prophylactic 
vaccination strategies, taking into account the costs associated with program delivery and the projected reduction of RSV hospitalizations among 
infants under one year of age. We considered several immunization programs using palivizumab, nirsevimab, and ResVax, and calculated the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) to compare scenarios in mild, moderate, and severe RSV seasons.
